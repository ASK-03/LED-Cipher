# LED-Cipher

## Introduction

LED Cipher is a lightweight alternative to AES, specifically designed for resource-constrained devices. This repository includes:

- LED encryption function
- LED decryption function
- ECB mode encryption using the LED block cipher
- ECB mode decryption using the LED block cipher
- A hash function based on the LED block cipher using the Davies-Meyer construction
- A broadcast client-server CLI system with three communication channels, featuring:
  - Asymmetric key exchange using RSA
  - Symmetric key message encryption and decryption

_This repository showcases all the work completed by **Team-RSA** for the term paper._
